    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The War of the Five Kings is a famous civil war described in the well-known serious fantasy novel “Game of Thrones”. This is a civil strife with an unprecedented scale that involves seven kingdoms. As the name implies, a total of five persons claim to be the king during the war: Joffrey Baratheon, Stannis Baratheon and Renly Baratheon all claim to be the rightful heir of the iron throne. Moreover, Robb Stark is elected by the barons of the northern border to the King in the North, and Balon Greyjoy erects the flag of independence again and claims to be the King of the Iron Islands, in an attempt to shake off the ruling of the Iron Throne. \n",

    "We have provided the data analysis flow for this project, but you will have to complete the codes by yourself. Your failure to complete this project means you are temporarily incapable to achieve the nanodegree of data analysis (advanced). We suggest you achieve a nanodegree of data analysis (introductory) and master the knowledge required to proceed with the advanced course. \n",
    "\n",
    "Records in the process of data analysis are also an important part of the data analysis report. You can insert markdown cells where you need to record your key steps and reasoning processes during the data analysis. For example, what characteristics do data have? What do statistical data mean? What conclusion can you derive from visualization? What’s your analysis next step? Why do you perform the analysis? If you fail to do this, you can’t pass this project. \n",

Alternatively, a code cell can be executed using the **Play** button in the toolbar after selecting it. While the cell is running, you will see an asterisk in the message to the left of the cell, i.e. `In [*]:`. The asterisk will change into a number to show that execution has completed, e.g. `In [1]`. If there is output, it will show up as `Out [1]:`, with an appropriate number to match the \"In\" number."
